A Wolfenstein 3D ray-casting renderer. At the moment supports a 2D grid map of cells, with each cell being either a wall or empty space. 

Current features:
	- WASD movement and mouse look
	- Movement collision detection (you can't walk through walls)
	- Textured Walls
	- Map Importing (See ExampleMap.wolf for format)
	- A minimap if toggled on
Textures within this repository are taken (and some edited) feely from http://www.areyep.com/RIPandMCS-TextureLibrary.html.
